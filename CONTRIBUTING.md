# Contributing to Ruxe

Thank you for considering contributing to Ruxe, the Rust IDE. Collaborative effort is what makes open-source projects like Ruxe thrive.

## Getting Started

- Ensure you have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
- Fork the Ruxe repository on GitHub.
- Explore the project's issues page. If your concern or idea is already listed, join the conversation there.
- If your issue isn't present, open a new one. Please provide a clear description, steps to reproduce if it's a bug, and what you'd expect the outcome to be.

## Making Changes

1. Create a topic branch based on the main branch.
2. Group your commits logically.
3. Before committing, run `git diff --check` to catch any unnecessary whitespace.
4. Write clear commit messages and reference the corresponding issue number using `#` notation (e.g., `#123`).
5. If your changes require it, add tests.
6. Ensure all tests pass to confirm you haven't inadvertently broken any existing functionality.

## Submitting Changes

1. Push your changes to a branch in your fork of Ruxe.
2. Open a pull request to the main Ruxe repository.

## Building and Testing Ruxe

- Given that Ruxe is a Rust project, make sure you have the latest Rust toolchain installed.
- Use `cargo build` to build the project and `cargo test` to run tests.

## Additional Resources

- [Rust documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/)
- [General GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/)
- [GitHub pull request documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)

Your contributions are invaluable. Thank you for being a part of Ruxe's journey!
